Saliency Detection via Absorbing Markov Chain with Learnt Transition Probability (Include Code and Maps)


The code is for paper "Saliency Detection via Absorbing Markov Chain with Learnt Transition Probability" 
by Lihe Zhang, Jianwu Ai, Bowen Jiang, Huchuan Lu and Xiukui Li.
To appear in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING 2017

*******************************************************************************
The code is tested on Windows 7 with MATLAB R2014a.
*******************************************************************************
Usage:

>put test images into '\image'
>put their boundary maps into '\boundary-map'
>put their deep features into '\FCN-feature'
>run 'Saliency_AMC_AE.m'


Note:

1.Boundary maps are generated by [1].
2.Deep features are generated by the pre-trained FCN-32S network [2].
3.The technical report of AE code '\BNF_globalization-master' can be found at http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.02674v1.pdf
